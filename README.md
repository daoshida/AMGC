# AMGC
The model code for this paper is in AMGC_ResNet18.py. The model has been trained on the dataset, and the parameters are stored in AMGC_ResNet18.pth.
You can directly run the test.py file to test the model's accuracy. This test requires that all files be placed in the same directory.
If you are not performing this on JuPi Cloud (https://matgo.cn/login), you will need to use the code in nwrite_json.py to rewrite the Net_test1.json file.
